# tumblr-utils

This is a collection of utilities dealing with Tumblr blogs.

- `tumble.py` creates new posts from RSS or Atom feeds
- `tumblr_backup.py` makes a local backup of posts and images
- `export_email.py` mails tagged links to a recipient list
- `delicious_import.py` imports delicious.com links into Tumblr

These scripts are or have been useful to me over the years.

More documentation can be found in each script's docstring or in
[tumblr_backup.md](https://github.com/bbolli/tumblr-utils/blob/master/tumblr_backup.md).

### Acknowledgement

tumblr_backup.py was initially forked from
[bdoms/tumblr_backup](https://github.com/bdoms/tumblr_backup).
